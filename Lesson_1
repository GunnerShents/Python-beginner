welcome to your new course!!!!!!!!!

How this will work, all our code will be displayed in github, from here you, or I can easily copy and paste the code we are using into,
and from our IDLE. I will be using Sublime text 3. I reconmend you use Jupiter note book, but if you want to use the standard python 
IDLE then that will work as well.
 
Project 1/1:
Choose your IDLE and let me know, what you are using. Open a new file and save it as project_one.py
NOTE - Our IDLEs will help us write code after we have created the file, once the program knows it s a .py file
 
Sublime text/Jupiter note book or Visual studio code are excellent IDLEs and will help us write our code and handle errors once the file has been created as .py
It does this by colour coding our script and checking the white space. Image 1 show's my script from sublime text, you can see patterns of coloured text. 
What they mean and do we will learn soon.
 
You should now have a empty .py file infront of you. Project 1 will be a program to help us with our golf club selection process.
 
This will be a primitive program to show the basics of python.

Lets write some code:

Integer - This is a whole number e.g 1, 2, 3
Float - A decimal number e.g 3.14(pi)
String - Anything contained in ' ' or " ", e.g "I like Phil Shenton's course"
NOTE - if your using a ' in you text you need to use " " at each end!!

Variables - think of it as a box that holds a value, this allows us to call the box when and where we want e.g 
a = 7   (a is the variable, 7 is the value)
fruit = 'Apple' (Fruit is the variable, 'Apple' is the value)

Q1. What type is the value in a and what type is the value in fruit????
Answer :  

almost there before we, or should I say you write some code.

The print statement, allows us to print information, you can combine text and variables with f strings:

print('Hello world!!') 
NOTE - print() is a built in function within python, you can print most things with it.

print (f'add text and {variables} in here') - This is a f string syntax, all your variables need to be contained in {}
See below for an example.

OK copy this code line 44 to 51 into your IDLE and run it:

name = 'Phil'
age = 34
club_make = "Cobra Fly-Z"
handicap = 21

print ("My name is Phil, I'm 34 my handicap is 21") 
print (f"My name is {name}, I'm {age} my handicape is {handicap}") 

Both lines print the same thing, so why bother!!!!

Q2,
Now I want you to change the values of our variables to your details and print line 51 again. 
NOTE - strings are in ' ' integers are whole numbers.
send me your code from line 45 to 51 ignore line 50.

Say we had the hadicap variable printed in 100 lines of code and then are handicap dropped by 2 strokes.

How do we change all the info??? We could do this a few ways:

handicap = handicap - 2

or a better way:

handicap -= 2

Q3.
Now change your handicap by plus 1 stroke and change the make of clubs to a different brand. 
Prove this worked by printing a sentence that says "My new clubs are _______ and my handicap is_____" 
send me your code.

Ok last part to this lesson. Lists:
Lists are amazing mutable objects that allow us alot of freedom to use and abuse them.

Python Syntax

List_Name = [] - NOTE you need a name then an equals and then square brackets around your list objects, items inside need a comma in between them.

What can go in a list???? well most things. Lets make a list.

practice_list = ['Apple','Banana',7,3.14] - NOTE you can place anything in the list but if you mix types like integers and strings you may run into 
problems later on.

You can slice and index lists based on their postion. 

First postion in lists is 0. 
Apple is postion 0. 
7.9 is postion 3

I can print the last item like this:

print(practice_list[3]) - NOTE you call the variable and enclose the position in square brackets.

You can add to lists with the python append function:

practice_list.append('Orange') - NOTE the syntax is variable name (must be a list) .append() then add the new item in the brackets.

print (pratice_list)

Q4.

Create two lists one called golf bag and add 5 clubs of your choice.
Now create a list called distance and place the rough distance(in metres) for each club in that list.
Now append a putter in the golf bag and the distance of 50 in the distance list.
Send those four lines of code to me.

OK thats it for lesson one. We looked at variables, integers, strings, floats, the print function with f strings and started looking at 
lists.

Reseach questions, these wont take long, quick google:

Q5. What is camel case and give me an example.

Q6 Are lists mutable, what does mutable mean.

Q7. In python how do I check the type of a variable, if a = 'Hello and b = 7
    What code will return the type. e.g are they integers/strings/floats???
    
Q8. What is a function in programming, short answer :)

LAST THNG IS :

Create a github account and return the answers to me, make it private and copy your code from your IDLE into a github page 
label each piece of code with the question number so I can check it.
